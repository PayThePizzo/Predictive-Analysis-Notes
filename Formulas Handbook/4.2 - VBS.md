# Validation Based Selection
Each of the previous three metrics explicitly used p, the number of parameters, in their calculations. Thus, they all explicitly limit the size of models chosen when used to compare models. The calculations rely on an assumption of ”true” underlying model

Often times models are needed for out-of-sample prediction: **we need to quantify the possible error**.

## Leave-One-Out-Cross-Validation LOOCV
LOOCV gives a measure of the possible out-of-sample prediction error

1. **Fit** any model to the dataset available **without one observation** $i$
2. **Predict** $\hat{y_{[i]}}$: $y_{i}$ for the model in which $(x_{i}, y_{i})$ was not included in the model.
3. Now $e_{[i]} = y_{i} -\hat{y_{[i]}}$ is the residual for the ith observation, when that observation is not used to fit the model: 
   1. Namely, evaluating how well the model estimates it
4. Repeat the fitting of the model n times, once with each possible observation removed.

We can define the LOOCV RMSE to be:

$$RMSE_{LOOCV} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} e_{[i]}^{2}}$$

However, for leave-one-out cross-validation and linear models, the equation can be
rewritten as:

$$RMSE_{LOOCV} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} (\frac{e_{[i]}}{1-h_{ii}})^{2}}$$

Where:
* $h_{ii}$ are the leverages the diagonal elements of the projection matrix: $H = X(X^{T}X)^{-1}X^{T}$
* $e_{i}$ are the residuals

This way let us obtain the $RMSE_{LOOCV}$ by fitting only one model!
* In practice 5 or 10 fold cross-validation are much more popular. For example, in 5-fold cross-validation, the model is fit 5 times, each time leaving out a fifth of the data, then predicting on those values.

calc_loocv_rmse(lm(flipper_length_mm ̃ body_mass_g + bill_length_mm +
