# Validation Based Selection
Each of the previous three metrics explicitly used p, the number of parameters, in their calculations. Thus, they all explicitly limit the size of models chosen when used to compare models.

The calculations rely on an assumption of ”true” underlying model

Often times models are needed for out-of-sample prediction: we need to quantify the possible error.

First up: cross-validation
