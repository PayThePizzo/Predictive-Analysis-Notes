# GLM Residuals

• Residuals represent the difference between the data and the model and are essential to
explore the adequacy of the model.
• In the Gaussian case, the residuals are $r_{i} = y_{i} − \hat{y}_{i}$
.
• These are called response residuals for GLMs, but since the variance of the response is
not constant for most GLMs, some modification is necessary.
• The Pearson residuals are comparable to the standardized residuals used in linear models
and is defined as:

$$r^{p}_{i} = \frac{y_{i}-\hat{y}_{i}}{\sqrt{\hat{V}_{i}}}$$

(Crab data) We can obtain the deviance residuals as:
```R
residuals(model1)[1:5]
1 2 3 4 5
1.7903699 -1.7572153 3.1414336 -2.0951707 0.6101256
```
These are the default choice of residuals.
• The Pearson residuals are:
```R
residuals(model1,"pearson")[1:5]
1 2 3 4 5
2.0428979 -1.2425388 4.0582724 -1.4815094 0.6455594
```
If we use
```R
model1$residuals[1:5]
1 2 3 4 5
1.0287693 -1.0000000 2.5481128 -1.0000000 0.3790497
```

we obtain the working residuals, i.e.

$$\hat{\eta}_{i} + (y_{i} - \hat{\mu}_{i})\frac{d\eta_{i}}{d\mu_{i}}$$

For linear models, the plot of residuals against fitted values is probably the single most valuable graphic for model diagnostics.
• For GLMs: which residuals? Which scale (linear predictor or original scale?)
• In GLMs residual plots are much harder to read and verifying assumptions is more
complicated (so we don’t really focus on it during the course)

For GLMs, we must decide on the appropriate scale for the fitted values. Usually, it is
better to plot the fitted linear predictors.

$$\hat{\beta}_{0} + \hat{\beta}_{1}x_{i,1} + ... + \hat{\beta}_{p-1}x_{i,p-1}$$

rather than the predicted responses ˆyi
.
• Scatter plot of Deviance residuals against xj used to check whether any systematic
relationship is present: if so include xj
in the model.
• Plot working residuals against linear predictor. Plot should be linear - if not the link
function might be not correctly specified.
• Influential and leverage points can still be problematic: we can define leverage-aware
residuals, but we don’t discuss them in the course

## Example Galapagos Data

For 30 Gal´apagos Islands, we have a count of the number of plant species found on each
island and the number that are endemic to that island. We also have five geographic
variables for each island.
• We model the number of species using normal linear regression:
```R
data(gala, package="faraway")
gala <- gala[,-2]
```
• We throw out the Endemics variable (which falls in the second column of the dataframe)
since we won’t be using it in this analysis. We fit a linear regression and look at the
residual vs. fitted plot:

```R
modl <- lm(Species ˜ . , gala)
plot(modl, 1)
```

![galapagosres](https://github.com/PayThePizzo/Predictive-Analysis-Notes/blob/main/resources/galapagosres.png?raw=TRUE)

We see clear evidence of nonconstant variance
• the Box-Cox method reveals that a square-root transformation is a sensible transformation

```R
library(MASS)
boxcox(modl, plotit = TRUE)
```

![galapagosboxcox](https://github.com/PayThePizzo/Predictive-Analysis-Notes/blob/main/resources/galapagosboxcox.png?raw=TRUE)

```R
modt <- lm(sqrt(Species) ˜ . , gala)
summary(modt)

Call:
lm(formula = sqrt(Species) ˜ ., data = gala)

 We achieved this fit at the cost of transforming the response. This makes interpretation
more difficult.
• Furthermore, some of the response values are quite small (single digits) which makes us
question the validity of the normal approximation.
• This model may be adequate, but perhaps we can do better.

• Poisson regression

```R
modp <- glm(Species ˜ .,family=poisson,gala)
plot(residuals(modp) ˜ predict(modp,type="response"), xlab=expression(hat(mu)), ylab="Deviance residuals")
```

![galapagosdevres](https://github.com/PayThePizzo/Predictive-Analysis-Notes/blob/main/resources/galapagosdevres.png?raw=TRUE)

There are just a few islands with a large predicted number of species while most predicted
response values are small. This makes it difficult to see the relationship between the
residuals and the fitted values because most of the points are compressed on the left of
the display.

```R
plot(residuals(modp) ˜ predict(modp,type="link"),
xlab=expression(hat(eta)),ylab="Deviance residuals")
```

![galapagosdevres2](https://github.com/PayThePizzo/Predictive-Analysis-Notes/blob/main/resources/galapagosdevres2.png?raw=TRUE)

If we use response residuals

```R
plot(residuals(modp,type="response") ˜ predict(modp,type="link"), xlab=expression(hat(eta)),ylab="Response residuals")
```

![galapagosdevres3](https://github.com/PayThePizzo/Predictive-Analysis-Notes/blob/main/resources/galapagosdevres3.png?raw=TRUE)

We see a pattern of increasing variation consistent with the Poisson.
